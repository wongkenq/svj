            <p class="hidden">
                Judo comes from the original unarmed combat systems of Feudal Japan. Judo remains an efficient and practical self defense system and has evolved to use the sports ethic and mentality to give its practitioners live practical application.

                Judo is a social activity. No one can train without partners and so we grow together as a team. Joining Judo is joining a group of like-minded and motivated friends who can help each other achieve new goals.
